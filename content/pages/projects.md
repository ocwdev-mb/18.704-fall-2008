The term paper is to be a ten-page essay on a topic related to the course. The goal is for you to learn something new, and to explain it clearly to others in the class, or better, to other upper-class math majors. The paper must be written in a professional style, and formatted in AMS-LaTeX, like the papers in MIT's Undergraduate Journal of Mathematics. Some helpful resources are found in the {{% resource_link fee3b78c-47d5-bb0a-ca4c-895f418ec0ed "study materials" %}} section. If you do a good job on your paper, then, possibly after further editing, it can be published in the next volume. (MIT students only.)
