description: 'These files are the two source files and two compiled versions of the
  paper, "Writing a Math Phase Two Paper." It gives a lot of tips on writing a short
  math paper, and also serves as a model of one. The introduction describes MIT''s
  old Phase Two Writing Requirement; its content is, in part, no longer relevant,
  but it serves as a reminder to write an introduction that includes background material
  and that discusses the contents. '
